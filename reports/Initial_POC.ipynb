    "Demands on agricultural systems will increase as the world population increases.\n",
    "Labor costs are the dominant cost in most agricultural system.\n",

    "Controlled environment Agriculture (CEA) is an old idea gaining more recent momentum due to advances in automation, lighting and climate control.\n",
    "One of the fundamental challenges of CEA is optimal control of the growing environment.\n",
    "Traditional methods of optimal control in agriculture include reactive methods (thermostats) and predictive methods (PID).\n",
    "Reinforcement leaning(RL) is a well studied field that offers solutions for optimal control problems.\n",
    "The combination of RL and Deep Learning(DL) techniques created the collection of techniques known as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).\n",

    "1. climatic conditions outside historical training distribution (generalizable)\n",
    "2. quickly adapting to new growth environments (sample efficiency)\n",
